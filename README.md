# Anki-Templates-For-Language-Learning
This repo contains templates for Anki, the SRS. Specifically for language learners and polygots. It has specific styles for languages that use gender as well (i.e. masculine, feminine, neuter)

### Acknowledgements:
- [Fluent Forever](http://www.fluent-forever.com/) - This is the method I am using with Anki to learn languages
  - [Your first 625 Words - Base Vocabulary List](https://fluent-forever.com/the-method/vocabulary/base-vocabulary-list/) - This is a list of the first 625 words you should learn in your target language, based on the frequency of these words being used across all languages
- [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) - This is the tool that these templates are for
- [Project Lingual](https://projectlingual.wordpress.com/) - This is a blog by Owen Grey, who is someone that helped me create these templates. I took the [initial templates from this post](https://projectlingual.wordpress.com/2018/09/04/let-anki-do-that-revised/), then added spelling cards and pictures for gender mnemonics
- [Forvo](https://forvo.com/) - This site has a seemingly _endless_ supply of recordings of words in various languages by native speakers. This is used in the templates to fill the `Singular Recording` and `Plural Recording` fields in the templates.
- [Linguee](https://www.linguee.com/) - This site is a wonderful free online dictionary for many language -> language conversions, i.e. English to German (Deutsch)
- [Wiktionary](https://wiktionary.org/) - This site is another free online dictionary that has versions in many languages, i.e. [de.wiktionary.org](https://de.wiktionary.org/), that allows you to hear the pronunciation as well as see the IPA spelling of a word. If you look up the word in your target language on the target language version, you'll have great results
